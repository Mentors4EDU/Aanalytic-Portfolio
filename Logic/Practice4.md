**a)** \
For CPU it is (1/((1-0.60)+(0.60/1.4)) \
and you have $5000/(((1/((1-0.60)+(0.60/1.4)))) which is $41.4284 for a 120.69% upgrade \
while Disk is (1/((1-0.40)+(0.40/2.5)) \
and you have $8000/(1/((1-0.40)+(0.40/2.5)) which is an 131.58% upgrade for $60.7995 \
The best deal in obviously the CPU \
**b)** \
The highest speed would be the Disk (not considering costs) \
**c)** \
The breakeven point will be the CPU price with Disk percentage + $5000 so 1.3158(41.4284)+$5000= $5054.51 \
$5000 is the inital cost, $54.51 is the target upgrade cost instead of $60.7995. \

The four types are: Programmed I/O, Interrupt-Driven I/O, Direct Memory Access (DMA), and Channel I/O \
Programmed I/O is usually best suited for embedded systems processing and overhauling I/O requests for different controlled intrevals. \
Interrupt-Driven I/O works well for single-user systems and handle data outputs one byte at a time or in small incremental blocks. \
DMA is usually utilized in disk controllers, and graphic/sound cards, or network cards. The data transfer rate is more optimal. \
Channel I/O works well on complex mainframe systems and server architecture given it can perform more difficult tasks that require a higher degree of logic applied to each task as opposed to just transferring data.
