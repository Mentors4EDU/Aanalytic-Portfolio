In regards to direct implementation:
1. Reduced instructions
2. Ease of direct hardware control
3. Approximation
4. 3 Different Register Operancds
5. Few Addressing modes
6. Uniform pipeling time
7. Fixed-length/short direct instructions

In regards to what couldn't be implemented:
1. Difficult to implement multiple registers
2. Limitations on pipeline structuring and parameter passing
3. Access over load instructions for access memory
4. Micro-programmed controlled implmentations
5. Requires harded compiling in regards to implementation
